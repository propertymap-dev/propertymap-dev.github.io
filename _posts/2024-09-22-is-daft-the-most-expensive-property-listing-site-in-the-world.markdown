If you've ever tried to sell or rent a property in Ireland, you're probably familiar with **Daft.ie**—one of the largest and most well-known property listing sites in the country. But have you ever wondered just how much it costs to list your property there?

Surprisingly, Daft.ie could be one of the **most expensive listing platforms globally**. While most platforms charge reasonable fees, the cost of listing a property on Daft.ie can easily surpass €1,000 for a single property when you include premium listing features, particularly for "For Sale By Owner" (FSBO) properties. 

### Overview

In this post, we’ll break down the costs of listing a property on Daft.ie, examining two common scenarios: a landlord **renting** out a home and a private seller opting for a **"For Sale By Owner"** (FSBO) listing. By exploring these use cases, we’ll highlight Daft's pricing structure. 

Finally, we’ll compare Daft.ie’s pricing model to alternatives in other countries to see if it really is the most expensive property listing site in the world.

### Scenario 1: A Landlord Renting Out a Three-Bed House in Rathfarnham

Let's consider the case of a landlord renting out a furnished three-bedroom house in **Rathfarnham** for €2,500 per month. The property has a B3 BER rating, is equipped with modern features, and is offered on a one-year lease. When the landlord looks to list the property on Daft.ie, they’re faced with three pricing tiers:

As you can see from the screenshot, the **Featured** tier offers the most visibility for €399, while the **Standard** tier costs €265 for a basic listing.

  
In our experience, the majority of landlords simply pay for the standard tier, given market conditions. They know they can fill a property regardless of views on the listing. 

### Scenario 2: A Four-Bedroom Family Home for Sale in Galway

Now let’s take the case of a family selling a four-bedroom house in Oranmore, Galway, priced at €450,000. The home is spacious, located in a desirable neighborhood, and ideal for a growing family. Like many homeowners, they turn to **Daft.ie** to list their property.

Daft.ie offers similar pricing options for property sales, except **significantly** more expensive. Here’s a breakdown:

### Comparing Daft.ie to International Property Listing Sites

To provide a clearer picture of how Daft.ie stacks up against global alternatives, we've compiled a table comparing the costs for our two scenarios: a landlord renting out a three-bedroom house and a family selling a four-bedroom home. 

It's important to note that private individuals cannot directly list properties on **Rightmove** or **Zoopla**. However, they can use third-party services like **OpenRent**, which uploads listings to both platforms for £49.

Here are 10 different international property listing platforms and their respective charges for these scenarios.

| Platform         | Scenario 1: Rent (3 Bed, Rathfarnham) | Scenario 2: Sale (4 Bed, Galway) |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Daft             | €321 (avg.)                           | €1999 (avg.)                     |
| OpenRent (Rightmove, Zoopla) | €57 (£49)                 | Not Available                    |
| Zillow           | Free                                  | Free                             |
| Realestate.com.au| €92 ($150)                            | Not Available                    |
| Idealista        | Free (for listings under €2,500)      | Free (for listings under €1M)    |
| ImmobilienScout  | Free                                  | Varies per region                |
| MagicBricks      | Free                                  | Free                             |
| FSBO.com         | Not Available                         | €89 ($99.95)                     |
| FazWaz           | Free                                  | Free                             |

Daft.ie employs a dynamic pricing model, meaning the cost to list a property scales based on factors like property location, type, and market demand. For instance, rental listings in high-demand areas like Rathfarnham could incur different fees compared to properties in less sought-after regions. This pricing strategy stands in contrast to many international platforms that offer flat or free listings.

From the platforms we examined, Daft.ie does appear to be among the most expensive for private listings, particularly in the context of selling a property. While many international property platforms offer free or significantly cheaper listing options, Daft’s pricing can exceed €1,000 for a single sale listing. However, if you know of a more expensive platform, we'd love to hear from you!

For those looking for a more affordable, hassle-free alternative to list their property in Ireland, PropertyMap.ie offers a compelling option. With free base listings and a flexible pricing model for additional features, PropertyMap.ie provides Irish sellers and landlords a cost-effective solution while still gaining strong market exposure.
