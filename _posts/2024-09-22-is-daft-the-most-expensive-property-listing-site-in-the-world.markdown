But have you ever wondered just how much it costs to list your property there? In this post we will compare the prices of Daft.ie to listing platforms in other countries.

|------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Daft             | €321 (avg.)                           | €1999 (avg.)                     |

| Zillow (USA)           | Free                                  | Free                             |
| Realestate.com.au (Australia) | €92 ($150)                            | Not Available                    |
| Idealista (SPain, Italy)       | Free (for listings under €2,500)      | Free (for listings under €1M)    |
| ImmobilienScout (Germany)  | Free                                  | Varies per region                |
| MagicBricks (India)    | Free                                  | Free                             |
| FSBO.com (USA)        | Not Available                         | €89 ($99.95)                     |
| FazWaz (Brazil)           | Free                                  | Free                             |

Many listing sites only offer one of the two options eg. OpenRent only allows rentals and FSBO.com only allows sales. 

### Conclusion

Daft.ie is among the most expensive platforms for private listings globally. The high costs aren't just a burden for landlords and sellers—they often get passed onto tenants and buyers, further inflating the housing market. Daft also makes more money as rental prices increase, adding to the overall cost for consumers. 

For a cost-effective alternative in Ireland, **PropertyMap.ie** offers free base listings and flexible pricing for additional features.
